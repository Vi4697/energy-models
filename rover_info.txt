### 🧩 **What to Fix or Improve**

Please review our logic and **modify/correct the following**:

1. Ensure tasks are only scheduled if energy is available (from RTG + current SoC)
2. Do not allow battery SoC to drop below 47%
3. Model **overnight recharging** (\~700 Wh over 10–12 hours of idle time)
4. Support task priority (float 0–1) to select most valuable tasks
5. Prevent overlapping high-load tasks if they exceed RTG + battery peak capacity (\~900 W)
6. Log total energy used, unused RTG energy, and SoC at end of sol
7. Visualize energy timeline, task timeline, and SoC over sol

I’ve reviewed the code structure from your core simulation files. Your Python project already has a modular structure for modeling energy usage (`energy_model.py`), rover parameters (`rover_config.py`), and mission simulation logic (`simulate_mission.py`). It also includes a central execution file (`main.py`).

Now, here’s the **revised and adapted prompt** specifically tailored to your **existing project** so that Claude (or any LLM) can accurately **enhance your logic** to reflect real-world Mars rover behavior:

---

## ✅ Prompt to Claude (Adapted for Your Project)

We are building a Mars rover simulation using Python and MATLAB for energy-aware task scheduling. Our project already contains these key files:

* `models/energy_model.py`: Defines energy consumption and SoC logic
* `models/rover_config.py`: Stores configuration like energy limits and RTG values
* `sim/simulate_mission.py`: Schedules and runs task simulations
* `main.py`: Entry point for running and visualizing simulations

We need your help to review and **correct/improve our logic** so it reflects **real-world rover operations**, specifically based on **NASA’s Perseverance rover**.

---

### 🎯 Project Goals

Our Python simulation must:

* Accurately track battery SoC and energy usage
* Prevent invalid task execution (e.g., not enough energy)
* Enforce real rover energy constraints
* Recharge batteries overnight
* Support task prioritization and scheduling
* Integrate with MATLAB visualizations (we handle this part separately)

---

### 🧠 Real-World Constraints to Enforce in Code

#### 🔋 Rover Power System (MMRTG + Battery)

* **RTG output**: \~110 W continuous
* **Daily energy available**: \~2.5 kWh
* **Battery capacity**: \~2.4 kWh, but only \~53% usable (\~1.3 kWh)
* **Battery SoC at sol start**: \~90–100%
* **Overnight recharge rate**: \~700 Wh (from idle RTG power)
* **Max instantaneous load**: \~900 W (RTG + battery surge)
* **Idle consumption**: \~40 W (always active)

---

### 📦 Task Format in Our System

Each task is defined with structure like this (JSON or class instance):

```python
{
  "name": "drill_core",
  "duration_sec": 600,
  "power_w": 600,
  "priority": 0.9
}
```

> Claude: If the code uses a different structure, adapt this logic to the current data classes.

---

### ✅ What to Improve in Our Code

1. ✅ Validate if **task execution only occurs** when enough energy is available
2. ✅ Ensure **battery SoC never drops below 47%**
3. ✅ Implement **overnight recharge model** (\~700 Wh added after each sol)
4. ✅ Enforce **900 W peak load limit** for overlapping or long tasks
5. ✅ Add **idle energy usage** per second (40 W baseline)
6. ✅ Add total SoC tracking per time step
7. ✅ Allow **priority-based task selection** if full list doesn’t fit
8. ✅ Improve task scheduler in `simulate_mission.py` to:

   * Defer tasks when needed
   * Optimize sol energy usage
   * Log skipped or partially completed tasks

---

### 🧪 Simulation Outcomes We Want

Claude, your logic should ensure:

* Accurate `energy_used`, `battery_soc`, `energy_remaining`
* Tasks that exceed energy are logged and skipped or rescheduled
* A complete list of scheduled vs. skipped tasks per sol
* Energy graphs are valid input for MATLAB visualization (`test_simulation.m`)
